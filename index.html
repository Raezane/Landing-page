        <p class="imagetext">We don't know how big it is. Current estimates as with 
          regards to the size of the Universe pegs it at a width of 150 billion light 
          years. Although it may seem peculiarly inconsistent with the age of the Universe, 
          this value is easily understood once you consider the fact that the Universe is 
          expanding at an accelerated rate.</p>

        <p class="imagetext">Considering only the largest structures, the Universe is made up of 
          filaments, voids, superclusters, and galaxy groups and clusters. By combining galaxy 
          groups and clusters, we come up with superclusters. Some superclusters in turn form part
          of walls, which are also parts of filaments.</p>

          are made up of bits of ice and rock. They form when asteroids, comets,
          or any other large objects pass too close to the planes and are torn
          apart by the planet's gravity.</p>
